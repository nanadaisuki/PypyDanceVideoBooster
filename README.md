# PypyDanceVideoBooster

When you play a certain video in PypyDance, this software will help you create a video cache, and then when the video is played again, it will read the cache directly from the hard disk, thereby preventing network problems from causing the video to not be played. 

This software is specially designed for dancers. It guarantees the usability of the video playback function, even at the expense of Avatar loading performance when necessary, so this software is not suitable for normal players. 

Due to copyright issues, some videos have been deleted from some CDN nodes, so you may encounter 404 Not Found. This problem should be fixed in the next version. 

__Any player is prohibited from spreading the cache files generated by this software, absolutely not! Otherwise Sadako will knock on your door in the middle of the night.__


## User Guide

__Parameters__

-port=<port> 
  
  Specify the CacheServer port.
  
-dev=true 
  
  Enable developer mode.
  
-buildlist 
  
  If you have obtained the original playlist data through some channels, running this command will convert the format required by the software. ({"exampleVideoId1": "exampleVideoName", "Ab12Cd3E": "This is video name"})
  
 -buildcache 
  
  In order to prevent players from misusing this feature to cause pypy's server failure, this feature has been removed, and it is now an empty method. 
  If you obtain the video files by other means, you can put these video files in the media folder. If these video files happen to be consistent with the requirements of PypyDance, they will be treated as effective caches.

Because the api was changed to https, this caused the main function to fail. Although it returned to normal after some repairs, it was a little troublesome to use. 

  1. Install Java from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html
  2. Run cmd and execute command "keytool -genkey -keyalg rsa", no matter what it asks you, answer "jd.pypy.moe".
  3. You will got a ".keystore" file in your user home directory, then execute command "keytool -export -keystore .keystore -file publickey.cer".
  4. You will get an HTTPS certificate, but it is not legal yet, so you need to force the operating system to trust this certificate and install it to the trusted root certification authority directory with your mmc console. You can find related tutorials on Google. 
  5. Run cmd and execute command "java -jar PypyDanceVideoBooster.jar -port=12345 -dev=true", you can see "Cache launched".
  6. Install Proxifier and open RuleList.ppx file, the file can be download from main page.
  7. Open the privacy window of your browser, then enter the link "https://jd.pypy.moe/api/v1/videos/GNxgQK50KWE.mp4", when browser says you are at risk, click Advanced and click Continue.
  8. Now is the time to witness the miracle, if you do nothing wrong, Marshell will appear on your screen. 

Finally, this is a hasty development. The old CDN network is still being used. In future versions, it will be switched to the new CDN network in a more friendly way, and network bandwidth consumption will be further improved. 

You can use some methods(such is Proxifer) to introduce the socket to "storage-cdn.llss.io" into this program, and then it will automatically manage your cache. 
It is worth mentioning that only when a file is fully loaded will it be considered as a valid cache. This is to avoid the "206 partial content loop" when the network is poor.
